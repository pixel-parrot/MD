------GIT CODE MANAGEMENT NOTES----------------------------
To initialize the push/pull commands:
git remote add origin https://MistDude@bitbucket.org/MistDude/md.git

Username on Bitbucket:
MistDude
Password on Bitbucket:
ilikemoneyilikemoney

To pull from a repository branch into a local branch, first make sure you are in
    the branch you want to be in, then:
git pull origin <name of remote branch>
For example, from the MistDudette branch, do:
git pull origin MistDudeStable

To push a branch onto bitbucket, first make sure you are in the branch you want
    to push, then:
git push origin <remote branch to push to>
example: git push origin MistDudette

To create a new branch based off of a different existing branch on your
    local machine:
git branch <new branch name> <branch to copy from>
To get to that branch:
git checkout <branchname>

To delete a branch, first checkout to a different branch then use:
git branch -D <branch to delete>

To merge changes into a branch from another branch:
(for example, to update MistDudetteStable with changes from MistDudette)
First checkout to the MistDudetteStable branch.
git checkout MistDudetteStable
Then merge in the changes:
git merge MistDudette
Finally, push those changes to the web:
git push origin MistDudetteStable

If you ever need to pull just one file from a different branch into the
    branch you are working in currently use (making sure you are in the right
    directory):
git checkout <branch that has the file you want> <filename>

If there are changes to a file that are staged for a commit, but you want to
    revert to way it was before you made changes (cannot undo this):
git reset HEAD <filename>
git checkout <filename>
